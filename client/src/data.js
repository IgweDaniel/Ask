      "No, ‘I see him last night’ is always incorrect and will be only just barely understandable. It is a very serious and basic error, and it will be tiring for a native speaker to converse with someone who speaks like this, because they will constantly have to be remembering what the person really means. It will not be ‘immediately obvious without thinking about it’.Someone just asked this question recently, and I replied, saying that ‘I see him last night’ is never correct. That is exactly what i meant.",
